#### Thank you for your donation to Pyjamas Conf 2022

Thank you for all the support to Pyjamas Conf 2022. We have gathered around USD $280 from donation and we have now donated them to [the Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/donations/).

Stay tuned to more news about Pyjamas Conf. In the mean time, you can still buy merch from [our merchshops](/blog/merch-shop-launch).
