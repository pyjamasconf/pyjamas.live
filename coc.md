### Purpose
Pyjamas is dedicated to providing an enjoyable and harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or lack thereof.
We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
We expect all community participants to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.
All attendees - delegates, speakers, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors and organisers - are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. If necessary, the organisers will act to enforce it.

### Communication

All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may include children and people from many different backgrounds.
Sexual language and imagery are not welcome.
Please be thoughtful when making jokes or discussing sensitive topics or issues that are likely to have a strong personal effect on some people. If in doubt, ask for advice or simply moderate your expression.


### Expected Behavior

Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
Attempt collaboration before conflict
Use inclusive language
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

### Inappropriate Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but is not limited to:
Abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions
Sexual images
Harassing, intimidation, or stalking
Sustained disruption of talks or other events
Inappropriate online contact
Invasion of personal space
Unwelcome sexual attention
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).


### If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. There is very little harm in an unnecessary report, but potentially significant harm in an unreported problem.
We will publish during the conference information on where to make a report. Contact through Discord @Sandrine for the communication of any unacceptable behaviour, fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LpZLXUYy1aREUCsAaLrHjQtemY67D9QSvYdNjUepImg/edit) or email us at pyjamasconf@gmail.com.
When taking a personal report, with your agreement, the staff members may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. This report will remain private.
If you report using Discord private chat, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you.
If you prefer the email, please send a report with as much information as available.
You won’t be asked to confront anyone and we won’t tell anyone who you are.
We value your attendance.

### Anonymous report

You can make an anonymous report [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LpZLXUYy1aREUCsAaLrHjQtemY67D9QSvYdNjUepImg/edit).
Be aware that we can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the event organizers with a concise description of your grievance.
Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.
