  name: "Mirko"
  surname: "Galimberti"
  bio: |
    Before being a Software Developer, I have been (not so secretly) tech-addicted, especially when it came to computers.

    I had my first tech bag at age of 11 (nothing so fancy and expensive) but was a nice set of hardware and software tools to fix the most common computers issues.

    Later, during my early high-school years, even if only C++ and Java were an option during classes, I started learning PHP + JS + HTML5 + CSS3 for a project that I started with a schoolfellow, that‚Äôs where I first approached web development.

    As my homepage says, now I‚Äôm a Full Stack Developer based in Italy. When I‚Äôm not in front of my laptop screen, you can find me traveling and piloting a drone for aerial photography. I love to listen to EDM music while stuck in traffic or during open-air festivals.

    In 2021 I joined the Core Developers team, and I try to do my best to keep Kivy up-to-date and grow the community.

    Kai Katschthaler is a mental health advocate and activist. In 2016, they started ‚ÄúTaboola Rasa ‚Äî A Clean Slate for Mental Health.‚Äù Taboola Rasa is a mental health awareness project that seeks to erase the stigma associated with many mental health struggles and diagnoses by asking people to share their mental health experiences. Kai believes that talking about mental health openly creates awareness, combats misinformation, and makes others feel less alone. Often enough, it also makes others feel safe enough to talk about their mental health and access the help they may need.

    The topic of mental health also bleeds into Kai‚Äôs work as a DevRel consultant and tech content specialist, where they always push for more diversity, equity, and inclusion. Topics they‚Äôre excited to talk about aside from mental health are: wild swimming, dogs, TV shows, sci-fi and fantasy, learning to code, and food.
