  name: "Bojan"
  surname: "Miletic"
  bio: "💡After being a Lead Python Developer for a company in Silicon Valley, I decided to leave that job and make my own company in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Sounds like a weird decision to make, like some sort of a “downgrade”. Trust me, it couldn’t be further from the truth.

📊 One thing you learn in the West is to take calculated risks when you see an opportunity.

Novi Sad in Serbia is slowly, but surely becoming a new Silicon Valley with 10 billions of IT investment pouring in.

My goal was to transfer western business knowledge, experience and entrepreneurial spirit to a new environment.

💻 I believe in good technology and all the benefits it brings to modern people.
👂  Communication is my primary skill. Always there to listen. Can’t help and solve if you don’t listen.
📚 I believe life-long education. Reading fan.
(And talking about Unicorns. 🦄)

People are our focus. Be it employees or users."

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. A father and husband, trying to learn to balance his natural nerdiness with family life. He enjoys a good strong dark ale, hoppy IPA, some team building Artemis, and epic Gloomhaven campaigning.

He has recently dove headfirst into Fedora since IBM buying Redhat, but still secretly wants FreeBSD everywhere. He’s always trying to become a better web technology developer, though normally just uses bash to get the job done."
