  name: "Bojan"
  surname: "Miletic"
  bio: "üí°After being a Lead Python Developer for a company in Silicon Valley, I decided to leave that job and make my own company in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Sounds like a weird decision to make, like some sort of a ‚Äúdowngrade‚Äù. Trust me, it couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.

üìä One thing you learn in the West is to take calculated risks when you see an opportunity.

Novi Sad in Serbia is slowly, but surely becoming a new Silicon Valley with 10 billions of IT investment pouring in.

My goal was to transfer western business knowledge, experience and entrepreneurial spirit to a new environment.

üíª I believe in good technology and all the benefits it brings to modern people.
üëÇ  Communication is my primary skill. Always there to listen. Can‚Äôt help and solve if you don‚Äôt listen.
üìö I believe life-long education. Reading fan.
(And talking about Unicorns. ü¶Ñ)

People are our focus. Be it employees or users."
