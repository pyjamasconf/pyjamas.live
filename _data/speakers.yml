  name: "Bojan"
  surname: "Miletic"
  bio: "💡After being a Lead Python Developer for a company in Silicon Valley, I decided to leave that job and make my own company in Novi Sad, Serbia.

Sounds like a weird decision to make, like some sort of a “downgrade”. Trust me, it couldn’t be further from the truth.

📊 One thing you learn in the West is to take calculated risks when you see an opportunity.

Novi Sad in Serbia is slowly, but surely becoming a new Silicon Valley with 10 billions of IT investment pouring in.

My goal was to transfer western business knowledge, experience and entrepreneurial spirit to a new environment.

💻 I believe in good technology and all the benefits it brings to modern people.
👂  Communication is my primary skill. Always there to listen. Can’t help and solve if you don’t listen.
📚 I believe life-long education. Reading fan.
(And talking about Unicorns. 🦄)

People are our focus. Be it employees or users."

  bio: "I am a Software development Engineer working at *Grofers* the largest grocery delivery service in India. Who started his journey of computer science since he was 5. Dwelled into gaming at an early age made me comfortable working with computers and now my aim is to make technology comfortable for each and everyone in the world.

I have been part of the developer community from quite a few times and have been and *won various hackathons* and from that, I have learned it making a product is not the tough part, maintenance and documentation is what that takes more time and effort. I have designed and created various software solutions for startups not just creating them but making them as pythonic as possible.

I think we python developers should contribute to the standards of **pythonic thinking** to make this community bigger and better. Writing software with maximum readability and of global standards. Imagining a life where people read python code like they are reading a book. And as well as following the best coding practices which include one line deployments and running the software.

*I have been organizing and taking part in teaching web development through python and Django framework, Distributed computing as well as docker and Kubernetes to my juniors in college* and tell them about what I learned from writing a bazillion lines of code and what is the best practice. I write the code for the long run in a fast, efficient and standard way.

*I love discussing new ideas and contribute my skills and knowledge.*
