The system allows to analyse the best ways to manage the gates in order to optimise waiting and traffic time and parking spaces. Future plans for the project include deploying the system on the streets and public parking spaces of Rwanda."

And with rare exception, we were all taught wrong. In this talk, Jason C. McDonald, author of the upcoming book 'Dead Simple Python' (No Starch Press), explores how objects are really supposed to be designed and used, and how that insight will transform how you design your classes forever. Whether you've been coding in Python for ten minutes or ten years, you're almost certain to walk away with a new perspective on this most elementary of code structures."
