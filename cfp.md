#### Call for proposals (CFP)

Today we are also opening our CFP! Submissions to speak at Pyjamas Conf 2020 will be accepted from 4rd September until **<s>4th October</s> 18th October, anywhere on earth (UTC+12)**. All talk slots will be 25 mins: 20 mins plus 5 mins Q&A or 25 mins without Q&A. Since the conference runs for a full 24 hours, you can select the time block that you would like your talk to be in. We welcome submissions from everybody, including those:

* who have never given a conference talk before,
* who are new to Python,
* who have built interesting things in Python,
* who have helped build Python,
* who wants to talk about the Python community, and
* who have the expertise to share with our community from fields outside of Python (and outside of technology).

If you’ve never presented at a conference before and you think you might like to try it, we want to hear from you! Pyjamas Conf actively welcomes and encourages new speakers to the conference.

#### Sign up to be a reviewer

Calling for reviewers for the PyjamasConf 2021!!! As a reviewer, your responsibility is to:

***review and vote for all the CfP within a week after the CfP closes***

It requires a lot of hard work but ***you have the power to choose which talks should appear in the PyjamasConf's Program***. We want to give the Python community a strong voice in deciding what the conference program should include.

As PyjamasConf 2021 is an online conference with talks and attendees across the globe the organizing committee will try to ensure that we have a representative sample of reviewers across the globe and with various backgrounds.
